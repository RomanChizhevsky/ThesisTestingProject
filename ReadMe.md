This repository contains the HTML page that is closely emulating the one given in the assignment.

Regarding the initial design provided, my only observation with it was that it was rather busy, 
and I personally incorporated a much simpler background design, as it makes the overall view of the page less jumbled.

Nonetheless, it was a fun challenge to complete the page without using front-end/back-end languages at all.

Thank you for the opportunity.
